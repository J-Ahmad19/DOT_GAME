# 🎮 Game of Dots

Game of Dots is a **fun, interactive, turn-based strategy game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Inspired by the classic "last move loses" logic, it challenges two players to outwit each other by removing dots wisely from colored circles. Simple to play, yet tricky to master!
